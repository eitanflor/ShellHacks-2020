<h5 align=center>A Cloud-Native Infrastructure for License Plate Recognition and Text Extraction with Python Integration</h5>

## About The Project

The inspiration of this project stemmed from the passion of leveraging emerging technologies such as Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in real world applications. As such, a use case was explored where a cloud-based infrastructure on the Google Cloud Platform could be integrated at AutoNation to provide a personalized customer experience specifically in the service center department by extracting the text from the license plate of a car and retrieving relevant customer information from a database using the value of the license plate as a lookup criteria. Key information such as scheduled appointments, reason for visit, and customer contact information could be used by a service advisor at AutoNation to speed-up the check-in process and promote a high-quality customer-centric environment.

#### Future Work and Relevancy
This project has the potential to further expand on the existing cloud infrastructure to intelligently automate status updates, appointments, document signing, customer checkout, car inspections, and rating or reviews of service. Additionally, given the current situation regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, a health aspect can be incorporated to notify customers of high density hours, reminders to social distance, locations of sanitizing stations across the AutoNation facility, and the ability to expedite/delay appointments in intervals (i.e., 15 min, 30 min, 1 hour) in response to high or low activity at a given location.
